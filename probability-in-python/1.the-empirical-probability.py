#Whenever we can't predict outcomes with certainty, we're dealing with a random experiment.
#Although we can't predict the outcome of a random experiment, we can at least estimate the probability (the chances) associated with its outcomes.
#A coin toss has two possible outcomes, and we can estimate the probability associated with the coin landing on heads or tails.
#In probability notation, we could write this as: Probability(coin lands heads up) = H/Total number of tosses = 0.56
#For simplicity, the notation is often compressed, and "Probability" becomes "P", while "coin lands heads up" becomes simply "heads" or H: P(H) = 0.56
#In other resources, we may find a slightly different notation, like p(H) or Pr(H), but P(H) is generally preferred.
#Generally, for any event E (like a coin landing heads up), we can find its probability by using the following formula: 
#P (E) = number of times event E happened / number of times we repeated the experiment.
#experimental â€” or empirical probability.

#Print p_tail, p_six, and p_odd to examine the probabilities:
p_tail=44/100.00
p_six=28.00/200.00
p_odd=102.00/200.00

print(p_tail)
print(p_six)
print(p_odd)
